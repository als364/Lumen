Lumen is an isometric 2D puzzle/adventure game set in a carnival where the lights suddenly go out. Darkness has taken over the carnival, creating eerie and unwelcoming shadows. The deepest, darkest reaches of the circus are rendered unreachable for a little girl (the player) who is trapped in the midst. Her fear of the dark discourages her from venturing from the light. Yet if she wants to escape the circus, she must illuminate these areas, banishing the shadows and reclaiming the circus one light at a time.
